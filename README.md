## A Blind Date is an unorthodox online dating website.

#### The reason behind creating this website was that I was not happy about the way online dating happens currently, and I feel that it is too materialistic. We judge people on the basis of their looks and decide whether we like them or not, even before we getting to know them. I wanted to change this, so I decided to make a dating website of my own.

#### In A Blind Date, you don't look at the pictures of other people, instead you get to know their thoughts about different things, and then make a decision whether you like them or not.
