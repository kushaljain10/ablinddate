    <div>
        <p>
            We welcome and appreciate you for trusting A Blind Date with your information and intend to keep that trust. We want to make sure that you understand what kind of data is collected, how is it stored and processed by us, so you understand that the entire process is safe. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes our privacy practices in plain language, keeping legal and technical jargon to a minimum. 
        </p>
        <h3>
            Who are we and why are we?
        </h3>
        <p>
            No we are not having an existential crisis, but I mean we sure have. But anyways, A Blind Date (“We”, “Us” and “A Blind Date”) is a dating website where people (“You” and “Users”) answer interesting questions and other users look at these answers and match with them, without looking at their pictures.
        <br>
            We are here, because we were tired of how the dating-tech industry has promoted the behavior of judging people based on their looks and failing to care about the person’s thoughts and personality.
        </p>
